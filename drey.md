Hi Drey,

Today you are tasked to create a simple application whih can do the following:

- Allow a user to login via username or password
- Group users around deparments (optional)
- Allow the system to assign a manager to the department (optional)

Feature:

- Track a set of points for each user. These points represent merits or demerits.
  - Each user starts with 10 points
- Each user is allowed to give a merit (+1) point or a demerit(-1) point to any other user
  - Each user is allowed 25 votes every month
  - Allow the user to add a reason (text) for each vote
- Show a page showing the total points of each user as well as the history of merits or demerits

Clone this repo and commit your work into this repo. We are also looking at the sizes and messages of your commits, so be mindful of that.

When you're done, or at 5PM, (whichever comes earlier), you can demo your work to the team and explain what you did and why you built your app this way.

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask any of us anytime.

Cheers, 

The Booky Tech Team
